# Async/Await Tasks in JavaScript

This project demonstrates various use cases of `async/await` in JavaScript, including iterating with delays, handling API calls, error handling, chaining async functions, and making concurrent/parallel requests.

## Tasks Included

1. **Task 01: Iterating with Async/Await**
   - Iterates over an array with a delay of 1 second between logs.

2. **Task 02: Awaiting a Call**
   - Simulates fetching data from an API with a delay and logs the response.

3. **Task 03: Handling Errors with Async/Await**
   - Enhances Task 02 to handle errors gracefully and log user-friendly error messages.

4. **Task 04: Chaining Async/Await**
   - Chains three async functions sequentially, each logging a message after a 1-second delay.

5. **Task 05: Awaiting Concurrent Requests**
   - Makes two API calls concurrently using `Promise.all()` and logs the combined results.

6. **Task 06: Awaiting Parallel Calls**
   - Fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently using `Promise.all()` and logs the responses.
